# Resturant-Management-System
I built a Restaurant Management System in C++ as my 3rd-semester project. This system streamlines restaurant operations by managing orders, generating bills, and maintaining an organized menu. It features an intuitive interface for efficient order processing and ensures accuracy in billing.
